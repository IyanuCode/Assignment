🧾 OOP Basics in C# – Practice Project
This project includes four structured exercises that demonstrate key OOP concepts such as classes, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and interfaces.

📁 Project Structure
✅ Exercise One:Create a class Book with properties Title, Author, and Price.  
Create an object of Book, assign values, and create a method to display the book details.
Defines a Book class with Title, Author, and Price properties.
Creates an object of the class and displays the book's information using a method.

✅ Exercise Two: Create a base class Vehicle with a method Drive().  
Create two derived classes Car and Bike that override Drive() with specific behaviors.  
Demonstrate polymorphism by calling Drive() on base class references.


✅ Exercise Three: TemperatureSensor Class
Create a class TemperatureSensor with a private field temperature.  
Provide public methods to set and get the temperature, ensuring the temperature is within a valid range (e.g., -50 to 150 Celsius).

✅ Exercise Four: Interface and Shapes
Define an interface IShape with a method CalculateArea().  
Implement Circle and Rectangle classes that implement IShape.  
Calculate and display their areas.
